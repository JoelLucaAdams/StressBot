# StressBot

A discord bot that manages stress levels through users. Created by Joel Adams engineering, inspired by Rhydian and the CompSci Community Hub. This is an open source project so feel free to suggest any issues or contribute to the code / design.

## Setup

Before using the bot you must create a `.env` file which includes the line `DISCORD_TOKEN=` followed by a discord token.

## Usage

Users can update their stress levels using the following commands:

`!Stress level` - change the users stress level

`!stress levels` - print out all users stress levels
