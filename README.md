# StressBot

A discord bot that manages stress levels through users. Created by Joel Adams engineering, inspired by Rhydian and the CompSci Community Hub

## Usage

Users can update their stress levels using the following commands:

```
Bob: !stress 90
StressBot: Bob's stress is now at 90%

Scott: !stress 40
StressBot: Scott's stress is now at 40%

Tom: !stress 0
StressBot: Tom's stress is now at 0%
```

Then, when a user prompts the bot, a scenario will play out:

```
Bill: !stress list
StressBot: Bob is on the verge of exploding (90% stress)!
StressBot: Scott is having a good time (40% stress)!
StressBot: Tom is sitting back laughing (0% stress)!
```
